  Humans as social beings rely on information provided by
  conspecifics. One important signal in social communication is eye
  gaze. The current study (*n* = 93) sought to replicate and extend
  previous findings of attentional guidance by eye gaze in complex
  everyday scenes. In line with previous studies, longer, more and
  earlier fixations for objects cued by gaze compared to objects that
  were not cued were observed in free viewing conditions. To
  investigate how robust this prioritization is against top-down
  modulation, half of the participants received a memory task that
  required scanning the whole scene instead of exclusively focusing on
  cued objects. Interestingly, similar gaze cueing effects occurred in
  this group. Moreover, the human beings depicted in the scene
  received a large amount of attention even though they were
  irrelevant to the current task. These results indicate that the mere
  presence of other human beings as well as their gaze orientation
  have a strong impact on attentional exploration.

# Introduction

Humans in their social environment rely on the information
conspecifics provide. This does not only hold for reading explicit
signals, such as verbal communication, but also for implicit signals,
such as eye gaze or nonverbal cues. Specifically, if an individual
looks into a certain direction, this information is often read
spontaneously by an observer who redirects his or her attention
towards the referred object or location. Such guidance of someone
else’s attention is called gaze following. As a consequence, joint
attention is established.

  <!-- gaze cuing to joint attenion & social attention -->

The most frequently used paradigm to investigate such attentional
shifts is the so-called gaze cueing paradigm [@Friesen1998;
@Driver1999; @Langton2000; for a review see @Frischen2007a]. This
paradigm has been inspired by classical studies on spatial attention
by @Posner1980 and consists of a centrally presented face with varying
gaze directions. This face is then followed by a subsequently
presented target at either the cued location (i.e., the location that
the face is looking at) or an uncued location (i.e., a location that
is not being looked at by the face). Studies using this gaze cueing
paradigm have demonstrated that gaze cues facilitate target processing
as evident in smaller reaction times to targets at cued as compared to
uncued locations [@Frischen2007a].  However, even though gaze cues are
crucial for joint attention, this standard gaze cueing paradigm can be
criticized for lacking ecological validity. Whereas in the real world,
gaze signals occur within a rich context of competing visual
information, gaze cueing studies typically used isolated heads
[@Friesen1998; @Langton2000] or even cartoon faces [@Driver1999;
@Ristic2005] as gaze cues [for an overview see:
@Risko2012]. Consequently, in a recent study in which @Hayward2017
compared attentional measures of gaze following from laboratory
(classical gaze cueing) and real world (real social engagement)
settings, they did not find reliable links between those measures.

  <!-- social attention -->

As a compromise between rich but also less controlled field conditions
and standardized but impoverished laboratory gaze cueing studies,
@Zwickel2010 used pictures of a full person (instead of isolated heads
or faces) as a directional cue within a naturalistic scene. In this
study, the authors used a free viewing instruction, meaning that
participants had no explicit task to fulfill but should just freely
explore the pictures.  <!--out?!-->@Zwickel2010 argued that the lack
of a specific task puts gaze following to a stricter test since
previous studies frequently used target detection tasks
[e.g. @Langton2017] or comprised specific instructions such as asking
participants to understand a scene [@Castelhano2007]. Consequently, it
remains unclear to what degree gaze following occurred spontaneously
or was caused by the specific task at hand.  In detail, @Zwickel2010
presented participants multiple 3D rendered outdoor and indoor scenes
for several seconds that always included two clearly visible objects
as well as either a person or a loudspeaker that was directed towards
one of these objects. The loudspeaker, that also represents an object
with a clear spatial orientation, served as a control condition to
ensure that gaze cueing effects are due to the social meaning (i.e.,
the direction of the depicted person’s gaze) as compared to a mere
following triggered by any directional cue.  The results of the study
showed that participants fixated the cued object remarkably earlier,
more often and longer than the uncued object. By showing that leaving
saccades from the head most often landed onto the cued object, the
results gave further evidence for the direct influence of eye gaze on
attentional guidance.  Crucially, similar effects were not obtained
for the loudspeaker as a non-social directional cue. The cued objects
were not just focused because they might have been salient by
themselves (e.g. due to positioning), or because they were cued by
another object, but became more salient by the person's reference.  To
sum up, @Zwickel2010 provide convincing evidence that joint attention
is a direct consequence of gaze cues and gaze following, it happens
spontaneously and has high relevance even in situations that are more
naturalistic (i.e., involve complex scenes and the absence of explicit
tasks) than classical gaze cueing studies based on variations of the
Posner paradigm.<!--softerer übergang pls-->

  <!-- Hypothesis -->

In the current study, we were first interested in whether the
previously reported effects hold when using a different set of
stimuli. Due to their low resolution and reduced richness of details,
the originally used 3D rendered scenes did not allow for an assessment
of the depicted person’s gaze direction. As a consequence, the
observed cueing effects could be rather due to directional information
inferred from both the body and head of the person.  We therefore
developed a new set of photographic stimuli that had sufficient
resolution to also allow for perceiving gaze direction with clearly
visible eyes of the depicted person. These photos always included a
human being who directed his/her gaze towards one of two objects that
were placed within reaching distance. In order to be consistent with
the study of @Zwickel2010, the depicted person’s head and body were
congruently aligned with his/her eye gaze.  Second, in order to extend
this line of research, we manipulated top-down attentional processes
by task instruction to explore the susceptibility of gaze following
effects in naturalistic scenes. Earlier research showed that social
attention can be influenced by multiple factors like social status of
the observed persons [@Foulsham2010] or action-related expectations
[@Perez-Osorio2015]. Together with @Zwickel2010, these studies have in
common that they manipulate viewing behavior of the participant by
manipulating the stimuli.  In contrast, in the present study, we tried
to modulate viewing behavior via task instructions. Specifically, half
of the participants received an instruction before the viewing task,
that they should try to remember as many objects from the scenes as
possible (explicit encoding group). For the other half of the
participants (free viewing group), the memory test that was
accomplished after the experiment was unannounced and therefore
reflected spontaneous encoding of the respective scene details.  The
motivation for this manipulation was twofold.  First, it was thought
to test the robustness of gaze following against top-down processes
[4] by discouraging observers to utilize the information provided by
the gaze.  Second, it allowed for examining gaze following effects on
memory.

We expected to replicate the findings of @Zwickel2010 in the free
viewing group. Specifically, we anticipated to observe an early
fixation bias towards cued objects, an enhanced exploration of these
details (i.e., more fixations and longer dwell times) and more
saccades leaving the head towards the cued as compared to the uncued
object.<!--Main effect icond, ANOVA--> The instruction in the explicit
encoding group was thought to induce a more systematic exploration of
the presented scenes resulting in higher prioritization of the uncued
object.  Furthermore, we anticipated a generally enhanced recall
performance in the explicit encoding group.  Due to the expected
difference in attentional resources spent on the cued and uncued
object in the free viewing group, memory performance of the cued
object is expected to be better compared to memory performance of the
uncued object.  Finally, as previous studies showed a strong
preference of fixating the head over body and background regions in
static images [@End2017; @Freeth2013; @Zwickel2010], we expected to
see a similar bias in the current study regarding dwell times, number
of fixations and fixation latency.  Additionally, we hypothesized that
the prioritization for the head decreases when participants follow
specific exploration goals such as in the explicit encoding group of
the current study [cf., @Flechsenhar2017].

# Methods

## Participants

The cueing effects in fixations and saccades that were obtained by
@Zwickel2010 can be considered large (Cohen's d~z~ > 0.70). However,
since effects of the top-down modulation implemented in the current
study might be smaller, we used a medium effect size for estimating
the current sample size. When assuming an effect size of Cohen's $f$ =
0.25 at an $\alpha$ level of .05 and a moderate correlation of .40
between factor levels of the within-subjects manipulation object role
(cued vs. uncued), a sample size of 66 participants is needed to
reveal main effects of the object role or interaction effects between
group and object role at a power of .95. Under such conditions, the
power for detecting main effects of group is smaller (1-$\beta$ =
.67). As a compromise, we aimed at examining 90 participants (plus
eventual drop outs) to achieve a power of .80 for the main effect of
group and > .95 for main and interaction effects involving the
within-subjects manipulation object role.

Finally, `r length(df.w.demo$vp)` subjects participated voluntarily. All
participant had normal or corrected vision and were recruited via the
University of Würzburg's online subject pool or by
blackboard. Participants received course credit or a financial
compensation of 5€. All participants gave written informed
consent. One participant was excluded due to missing data, resulting
in *n* = `r length(df.w.et$vp)` for the eye tracking analysis with `r
df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>% summarise(n_female = sum(sex=="1"))
%>% .$n_female` female and `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>%
summarise(n_male = sum(sex=="0"))%>% .$n_male` male participants
between `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>% summarise(min_age =
min(age)) %>% .$min_age` and `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>%
summarise(max_age = max(age)) %>% .$max_age` years (*M* = `r df.w.demo %>%

.$mean_age` years, *SD* = `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>%
summarise(sd_age = round(sd(df.w.demo$age),2)) %>% .$sd_age`
years). [11] Overall, participants scored very low for Autism traits
in the Autism-Spectrum Quotient scale [AQ-k, German version,
@Freitag2007 *M* = `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>%
summarise(m_aqk_sumscore = mean(aqk_sumscore)) %>% .$m_aqk_sumscore`,
*SD* = `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>% summarise(sd_aqk_sumscore =
sd(aqk_sumscore)) %>% .$sd_aqk_sumscore`]. Only, one participant
actually exceeded the proposed cut-off value of >= 17 for Autistic
disorders (*Max* = `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>%
summarise(max_aqk_sumscore = max(aqk_sumscore)) %>%
.$max_aqk_sumscore`, *Min* = `r df.w.demo %>% filter(vp != 23) %>%
summarise(min_aqk_sumscore = min(aqk_sumscore)) %>%
.$min_aqk_sumscore`).

## Stimuli and Apparatus

The experimental stimuli consisted of 26 different indoor and outdoor
scenes. In each scene a single individual was looking at one of two
objects that were placed within reaching distance. The direction of
the gaze (left/right) and the placement of the objects (object A and B
left/right) were balanced by taking 4 photographs of each scene (see
Figure \ \@ref(fig:ExampleStimulusset) for an example). [3] The
position of the individual in the photograph, was comparable to
@Zwickel2010 stimuli not controlled for, as a consequence participants
could not expect a specific spatial structure of the scene and the
gaze cue.  This created 104 unique naturalistic pictures in total. For
each participant, a set was randomly taken from this pool containing
one version of each scene, resulting in 26 trials. Eye movements were
tracked with the corneal reflection method and were recorded with an
EyeLink1000plus tower system at, a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. The
stimulation was controlled via Presentation® (Neurobehavioral
Systems). All stimuli had a resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels and were
displayed on a 24" LG 24MB65PY-B screen (resolution: 1920 x 1200
pixels, display size: 516.9 x 323.1 mm) with a refresh rate of 60
Hz. The viewing distance amounted to 50 cm thus resulting in a visual
angle of 38.03° x 28.99° for the photographs.

## Design and Procedure

The experimental design was a 2 x 2 mixed design. First, as a
two-level between-subject factor each participant was either assigned
to the free viewing or the explicit encoding group (instruction
group).  Additionally, as a two-level within subject factor object
role was manipulated, with objects being cued or uncued by the
depicted individual in the scene.

After arriving at the laboratory individually, participants were asked
to give full informed consent. Then the eye-tracker was calibrated for
each participant using a 9-point grid. According to the manipulation,
half of the participants were told that there was a follow-up memory
test for objects that were part of the depicted scenes. All
participants were then told to look at the following scenes freely
without specifying further exploration goals or mentioning the content
of the scenes. The presentation of the pictures was randomized. Each
trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross for one
second, followed by the scene for 10 seconds [12] comparable to
@Zwickel2010 and earlier studies [@End2017; @Flechsenhar2017]. The
inter-trial interval varied randomly between 1 and 3 seconds. After
the last trial, participants filled in demographic questionnaires and
completed the [11] AQ-k.  [6]~~The~~ Questionnaires were also introduced
to reduce recency effects in the memory task that was accomplished
afterwards. Participants were asked to recall as many objects from the
scene as possible and write them down on a blank sheet of paper. No
time limit was given but after 10 minutes, the experimenter asked
participants to come to an end. In fact, most participants stopped
earlier and indicated that they did not recall further objects.
Finally, participants received course credit or payment and were
debriefed.

## Data analysis

For data processing and statistical analysis, the open-source
statistical programming language *R* [@R-base][^Rpkg] was used with
the packages *tidyverse* [@R-tidyverse] and *knitr* [@R-knitr] and
*papaja* [@R-papaja] for reproducible reporting.  For the analysis of
the eye-tracking data, EyeLink's standard configuration was used to
parse eye movements into saccades and fixations. Saccades were defined
as eye movements exceeding a velocity threshold of 30°/sec or an
acceleration threshold of 8.000°/sec². Fixations were defined as time
periods between saccades.

We determined the following regions of interest (ROI) by color coding
respective images regions by hand using GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation
Program): the cued object, the uncued object, the head and the body of
the depicted person. Gaze variables of interest were calculated in a
largely similar fashion as in @Zwickel2010. Specifically, we
determined the cumulative duration and number of fixations on each ROI
per trial. These values were divided by the total time or number of
fixations, respectively, to yield proportions. As an additional
measure of prioritization, particularly for early attentional
allocation, we determined the latency of the first fixation that was
directed towards each ROI. These measures allow for effective
comparisons of prioritization between the two relevant objects and
between the head and the body. To reveal direct relations between the
head and the relevant objects, we calculated the proportion of
saccades that left the head region of the depicted individual and
landed on the cued and uncued objects, respectively.  The memory test
was scored manually by comparing the list of recalled objects to the
objects that appeared in the scenes. We separately scored whether cued
or uncued objects were recalled and ignored any other reported
details. Afterwards, we calculated the sum of recalled objects
separately for cued and uncued details.

In order to analyze the influence of the experimental manipulations on
eye-tracking and memory data, we carried out separate analyses of
variance (ANOVAs) with the package *car* [@R-car]. The ANOVAs had the
between-subject factor instruction group and the within-subject factor
object role and were conducted on the dependent variables fixation
latency, relative fixation duration, relative numbers of fixations,
proportion of saccades from the head towards the object and recalled
items. To examine general effects of social attention, separate ANOVAs
using the between-subject factor instruction group and the
within-subject factor ROI (head vs. body region) were conducted on the
dependent variables fixation latency, fixation duration and number of
fixations.  For all analysis the apriori significance level of
$\alpha$ = 0.05 was used. As effect sizes generalized eta-square
($\eta^2_G$) for ANOVAs are reported, where guidelines suggest .26 as
a large, .13 as a medium and .02 as a small effect [@Bakeman2005].

A significant main effect of object role in the analysis of fixation
latencies indicates earlier fixations on cued compared to uncued
objects, `r apa.anova.fixlat.gaze$full_result$icond`. The main effect of
instruction group was also significant, `r
apa.anova.fixlat.gaze$full_result$df_w_et_group`, with earlier
fixations on both objects in the explicit encoding compared to the
free viewing group. The interaction effect failed to reach statistical
significance, `r apa.anova.fixlat.gaze$full_result$df_w_et_group_icond`
(see Figure \ \@ref(fig:FigureObjects) A).

```

<!--#### Fixation duration & number-->
<!-- (H1, H2) -->

Largely similar effects were obtained in the analyses of fixation
duration and numbers (see Figure\ \@ref(fig:FigureObjects) B &
C). Significant main effects of object role indicated that
participants fixated the cued object longer, `r
apa.anova.fix.gaze$full_result$icond`, and more often, `r
apa.anova.fixn.gaze$full_result$icond`, than the uncued object.
Explicit instructions also led to longer, `r
apa.anova.fix.gaze$full_result$df_w_et_group`, and more fixations, `r
apa.anova.fixn.gaze$full_result$df_w_et_group`, on the objects as
compared to the free viewing condition. The interaction effects of
instruction group and object role were not statistically significant,
neither for the duration, `r
apa.anova.fix.gaze$full_result$df_w_et_group_icond`, nor for the
number of fixations, `r
apa.anova.fixn.gaze$full_result$df_w_et_group_icond`.

<!--### Saccades-->

```{r ANOVA saccades, warning = TRUE, message = TRUE}

<!-- (H1, H2) -->

Saccades leaving the head were more likely to land on the cued
compared to the uncued object as confirmed by a significant main
effect of object role, `r apa.anova.sac.fgaze$full_result$icond`. The
main effect for group, `r
apa.anova.sac.fgaze$full_result$df_w_et_group`, showed that saccades
of participants in the explicit encoding group were more often
directed towards any of the objects as compared to the free viewing
group. Again, the interaction effect of instruction group and object
role failed to reach statistical significance `r
apa.anova.sac.fgaze$full_result$df_w_et_group_icond` (see Figure\

An analysis of the recall data showed, that participants in the

the free viewing group, `r
apa.anova.mem$full_result$df_w_mem_bed`. Neither the main effect of
object role, `r apa.anova.mem$full_result$imem` nor the interaction

<!--#### Fixation latency-->

Fixation latencies differed remarkably between the head and the body
(see Figure\ \@ref(fig:FigureHead) A). Consequently, the ANOVA yielded
a significant main effect of ROI, `r
apa.anova.fixlat.face$full_result$icond` with earlier fixations of the
head compared to the body. There was neither a statistically
significant main effect of instruction group, `r
apa.anova.fixlat.face$full_result$df_w_et_group` nor an interaction of
both factors, `r

<!--#### Fixation duration & number-->

Fixation duration and numbers showed a very similar pattern with
longer, `r apa.anova.fix.face$full_result$icond`, as well as more
fixations, `r apa.anova.fixn.face$full_result$icond`, on the head than
the body ROI.  Remarkably, the instruction group did not exhibit a
statistically significant main effect, neither for the fixation
duration, `r apa.anova.fix.face$full_result$df_w_et_group`, nor for
the number of fixation, `r
apa.anova.fixn.face$full_result$df_w_et_group`. Furthermore, the
interaction effects of instruction group and ROI failed to reach
statistical significance for fixation duration, `r
apa.anova.fix.face$full_result$df_w_et_group_icond` and fixation
numbers, `r apa.anova.fixn.face$full_result$df_w_et_group_icond` (see
Figure\ \@ref(fig:FigureHead) B & C). These findings indicate that the
prioritization of social ROIs was unaffected by the explicit
instruction to attend to objects depicted in the scene.

# Discussion

<!-- Main motivation -->

By using naturalistic scenes with rich detail, this study aimed at
conceptually replicating previous findings of a general prioritization
of social cues [i.e. heads and bodies, @Birmingham2008; @End2017;
@Flechsenhar2017] as well as previously reported gaze cueing effects
elicited by a person being directed towards a specific object in the
scene [@Zwickel2010]. Both effects could be replicated.

In detail, heads of persons in the scene were fixated earlier and
explored more extensively as compared to body regions but also cued
and uncued objects.  Additionally, in line with @Zwickel2010, cued
objects were preferred over uncued objects. They were fixated
remarkably earlier, longer and more often. Thus, gaze following
effects did not only occur with respect to a more thorough processing
during the whole time of scene presentation but were also evident in
an early allocation of attentional resources after stimulus onset. All
these findings together indicate a strong and automatic bias of using
gaze cues for attentional guidance.

<!-- saccacades -->

Moreover, the prioritization of the head and the preference for the
cued object indirectly suggest a link between these two regions. To
investigate this relationship in more detail, we examined saccades
leaving the head towards the cued and uncued object,
respectively. Saccades leaving the head were significantly more likely
to end on the cued than on the uncued object directly linking
fixations of the head and the cued object.  Thereby, current results
fully replicate the findings of @Zwickel2010 with a more naturalistic
set of stimuli.  As often, by using more naturalistic material
experimental control is reduced. We tried to minimize unsystematic
effects by producing the stimuli in the same way as @Zwickel2010 but
using real as compared to 3D rendered scenes. In particular, each
scene was photographed four times with gaze direction an object
placement being fully counterbalanced. Since four individual
photographs of each scene were taken in the current study, we could
not fully control all stimulus aspects. However, the full replication
of the effects previously obtained with a different set of virtual
scenes indicates that these effects generalize to naturalistic
conditions and are stable against small variations in scene layout and
presentation.

<!-- top-down -->

Besides replicating previous findings, this study also aimed at
extending the line of research by testing the robustness of gaze
following against top-down modulations.  This was achieved by
instructing half of the participants to memorize as many details of
the presented scenes as possible. Since the depicted human were not
relevant to this task, we expected a generally reduced attention
towards head and body regions as well as a more systematic exploration
pattern, potentially reducing gaze cueing effects in fixations on and
saccades towards cued objects.  Unsurprisingly the memory task that
was accomplished after the eye tracking experiment showed that
participants, who knew about the free recall task in advance performed
better in recalling items. More interestingly, however, social
attention as well as cueing effects in viewing behavior were largely
unaffected by the explicit instruction to remember as many objects
from the scenes as possible.  Specifically, participants in the
explicit recall group did not show reduced attention towards head and
body regions as compared to the free viewing group. Moreover, whereas
they paid more attention towards depicted objects in general, gaze
cueing effects on fixation latencies and densities as well as the
direction for saccades leaving the head region did not differ
significantly between both experimental groups.

These findings indicate that the prioritization of social information
in general as well as of the cued objects in particular are largely
unaffected by a manipulation of goal-driven attention. The attentional
guidance of gaze was effective, even when participants investigated
the scenes with an explicit (non-social) task goal.  This provides
support for the automaticity and reflexivity of social attentional
processes and is in line with previous studies on gaze cueing within
highly controlled setups [e.g., @Ristic2005; @Hayward2017], more
naturalistic laboratory studies [e.g., @Castelhano2007; @Zwickel2010]
and real-life social situations [e.g., @Hayward2017;
@Richardson2007]. Moreover, the current results are consistent with
recent findings of an early attention bias towards social information
[@End2017; @Roesler2017] that seems to be relatively resistant against
specific task instructions [@Flechsenhar2017].

As expected participants with specific recall instructions performed
better in the subsequent memory task. However, the contribution of the
automatic attentional processes to memory encoding remains unclear.
In particular, although cued objects were prioritized in the
attentional exploration, this did not increase their probability of
being recalled. This is in contrast to studies on eye movements and
memory performance showing that increased attention results in better
memory performance [e.g., @Hollingworth2002] as [9] well as studies on
(non-social) cueing [@Schmidt2002; @Belopolsky2008].  From that
perspective, the cued object should have been recalled better than the
uncued object [@Schmidt2002; @Belopolsky2008]. However, another study
showed that if certain scene details have a special meaning (e.g., by
being central to the content of a picture story), attention does no
longer predict memory for these details [@Kim2013]. With respect to
the current study, these findings may indicate that both objects that
were placed within reaching distance of the depicted person conveyed
such meaning and were therefore remembered with equal
probability. Since we only tested for early memory effects, it would
be very interesting to delay the memory test by at least 24h to
examine whether memory consolidation differs between cued and uncued
objects [@Squire1993].

<!-- Limitations -->

Although the current study has several strengths including the
systematic generation of novel stimulus material and the large sample
size, it also has some limitations that need to be mentioned.  First,
although this study shows that humans follow other persons gaze
implicitly in unconstrained situations, this was shown for situations
without real interactions between humans. Research shows, that
fixation patterns differ remarkably when a real interaction between
persons is possible [e.g., @Hayward2017; @Laidlaw2011; for an overview
see: @Risko2016]. However, our findings add evidence to the classic
highly controlled laboratory approaches to social attention, yet at
the same time approximates more ecological research [@Risko2012].  An
additional critique might be that we did not control for directional
information from the depicted person’s body in contrast to the
head. Earlier studies show, that body orientation is relevant for
cueing [@Hietanen1999; @Lawson2016] and the influence of body
orientation on the cueing effects (e.g., through peripheral vision)
cannot be dissociated by our study design. However, our results
indicate a direct link between the head and the cued object, as does
@Zwickel2010. In fact, overall the first fixation of the body occurs
about 1 second after first fixation on the cued object.  <!--[3] A
third limitation might be, that participants expected a specific
structure for each scene, increasing reflexive shifts towards the
head. Although we did not controll for head position in the scene, the
head appeared most often in the center and everytime in the upper half
of the scene. To test this expectancies in participants one might
create scenes explicitly manipulating the position of the social
stimulus.  --> <!--Did we? [4] [is to take the motivation to utilize

-->

<!-- Conclusio -->

Overall, the current results provide additional support for previous
findings that attention is shifted reflexively to locations where
other persons are looking at [e.g., @Ristic2005; @Hayward2017]. This
evidence, which was previously extended to free viewing of more
complex static scenes by @Zwickel2010, was shown to be valid in more
naturalistic scenes and robust against top-down modulation. Even when
explicitly directing attention away from depicted individuals by
making objects task-relevant, social and joint attention were still
affected by the mere presence of a person, comparable to the unbiased
free viewing condition. These results indicate that the mere presence
of other human beings as well as their gaze orientation have a strong
impact on attentional exploration.
